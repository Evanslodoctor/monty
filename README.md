=======
The Monty Language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files

Compilation
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
The monty program
Usage: monty file
where file is the path to the file containing Monty byte code

##Tasks
Implement the push and pall opcodes
push pushes an element to the stack
pall prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack
